# Lead-Scoring-Case-Study

## Objective

This project is the case study on the problem from X Education company, which sells online courses to the professionals.
Their problem is that, only 30% of the applicants are getting converted.
So, a solution is demanded to acquire a conversion rate of 80%.
In this project we have tried to implement a model based on Logistic regression to achieve the above goal.

## Project Structure
- `Lead Scoring Case Study_Final_Version.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the code and analysis.
- `Lead Scoring PPT Final.pdf`: Presentation file summarizing the project.
- `Assignment Subjective Questions_Final_Version.pdf`: Document with answers to subjective questions.
- `Summary_Report_Final.pdf`: Summary report detailing the project findings.

## Installation Instructions
1. Ensure you have Python 3.10 installed.
2. Open the Jupyter notebook `Lead Scoring Case Study_Final_Version.ipynb` and run the cells in sequence.

## Steps Followed

This project case study is useful for all such platforms which are dealing with lot of applicants on the platform but a much smaller customer conversion rate e.g., let’s say people tend to try a free trial but won’t go for the paid version. It is hard for the companies to find potential customers.
This is how we have approached to the solution:

1. Reading the data dictionary.
2. Loading the dataframe.
3. Handling null values through imputation or removal.
4. Conducting Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).
5. Identifying optimal features using a hybrid technique (RFE + Manual).
6. Building a Logistic Regression model.
7. Addressing multicollinearity and rebuilding the model.
8. Deploying the model on the test dataframe.
9. Evaluating the model's performance.
10. Drawing conclusions based on the results.

## Conclusion and Recommendations
- Focus on features with positive and high coefficients to enhance target market strategies.
- Engage professionals for customized marketing materials and tailored infomercials.
- Optimize communication channels to improve lead engagement impact.
- Reallocate budget to increase spending on the Welingak website, which is the top performer.
- Implement commission incentives for the sales force to convert hot leads into customers, improving efficiency.
- Target working professionals, as they exhibit a high conversion rate and readiness to pay due to their stronger financial position.

This case study is built by a group of three students of a master’s program.
